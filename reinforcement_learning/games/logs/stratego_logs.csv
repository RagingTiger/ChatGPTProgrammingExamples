### Import Libraries 
import numpy as np 
import random 

### Define the Stratego Board 
board_size = 8
board = np.zeros((board_size, board_size))

### Define the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm 
def reinforcement_learning_algorithm(board):
    # Initialize the Q-Table
    q_table = np.zeros((board_size, board_size))
    
    # Set the learning rate
    alpha = 0.1
    
    # Set the discount factor
    gamma = 0.7
    
    # Set the exploration rate
    epsilon = 0.1
    
    # Set the number of episodes
    num_episodes = 1000
    
    # Train the algorithm
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        # Set the initial state to be (0, 0)
        current_state = (0, 0)
        
        # Initialize the reward 
        reward = 0
        
        # Loop until the episode ends
        while True: 
            # Choose an action using epsilon-greedy
            if np.random.rand() < epsilon: 
                action = np.random.randint(0, board_size)
            else:
                action = np.argmax(q_table[current_state])
            
            # Take the action and get the new state and reward 
            (new_state, reward) = take_action(current_state, action)
            
            # Get the max Q-Value for the new state
            max_q_value = np.max(q_table[new_state])
            
            # Update the Q-Table
            q_table[current_state][action] = (1 - alpha) * q_table[current_state][action] + alpha * (reward + gamma * max_q_value)
            
            # Set the current state to the new state 
            current_state = new_state
            
            # Check if the episode has ended 
            if is_episode_ended(current_state):
                break
            
    return q_table

### Define the Take Action Function 
def take_action(current_state, action):
    # Get the new state by taking the action 
    new_state = (current_state[0] + action, current_state[1] + action)
    
    # Get the reward by taking the action 
    reward = board[new_state]
    
    return (new_state, reward)

### Define the Is Episode Ended Function 
def is_episode_ended(current_state):
    # Check if the current state is the goal state 
    if current_state == (board_size - 1, board_size - 1):
        return True
    else:
        return False

### Run the Algorithm 
q_table = reinforcement_learning_algorithm(board)

### Print the Q-Table
